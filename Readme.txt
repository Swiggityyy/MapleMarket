Thoughts

Keep in mind this was for my own personal use. It did not automate or bot any part of Maple Legends. I did not touch the game's source code, I simply made a self-updating reference sheet so that I can check pricing on OwlRepo without having to look back and forth at a second monitor. It was a passion project that I completed in about 4-6 hours while hanging out with the guildies. If you have any questions, please reach out. IGN: SpaceBrownie Guild: Academy
